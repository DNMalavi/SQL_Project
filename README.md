# SQL Integrated Project: Maji Ndogo - Data-Driven Journey From Analysis to Action

**Author**: Derick Malavi  
**Course**: Data Science September 2024  

## Project Description
This project, titled *Maji Ndogo: Data-Driven Journey From Analysis to Action*, leverages Structured Query Language (SQL) to extract meaningful insights from a fictious dataset related to water resource management. The primary goal is to analyze the data and deliver actionable insights using SQL queries and advanced data manipulation techniques.

The project includes key SQL operations such as data querying, filtering, sorting, aggregation, complex joins, subqueries, and transactions. It also covers database design concepts like creating tables, data manipulation language, and optimizing queries for performance. Through these techniques, the project highlights how SQL can be leveraged to deliver data-driven decisions in resource management.

This SQL project serves as both an educational resource and a practical example of applying SQL to a real-world dataset, with the goal of providing valuable insights for decision-making.

## Key Features
- **Database Connection**: Establishing connection to a MySQL database.
- **Data Analysis**: Extracting meaningful insights from raw data using SQL.
- **Advanced Querying**: Using advanced SQL techniques such as filtering, joins, window functions, sub-queries, common table experssions (CTEs) and aggregation to analyze the data.
- **Report Generation**: Summarizing key insights into a data-driven report.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: Structured Query Language for querying and manipulating the database.
- **MySQL**: Database management system used for storing and managing data.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for interactive SQL querying and presenting the results in a readable format.
